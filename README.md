Dataset: 
Folder dataset contains the images downloaded from kaggle and stored to performing model traning and evaluations.

Models used to perform "Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning Techniques" are available in below notebooks:
We have performed our model traning and evaluations on,
1. Model tranings on compariosons between different models (Classifications model, Resnet, VGG19, Xception and Mobilenet): custom_and_pre_trained_classification_models.ipynb
2. Model tranings on RGB images, with augmentations : rgb_images_training.ipynb
3. Model tranings on Greyscale images, with augmentations : greyscale_images_training.ipynb
4. Model tranings on RGB images, without augmentations rgb_images_training_without_data_augmentation.ipynb
5. Model tranings on Greyscale images, without augmentations : greyscale_images_training_without_data_augmentation.ipynb
6. Model tranings on Yolo V& Greyscale images (Unable to complete as it was crashing due to memory issues): YoLo_v7_greyscale_images_training.ipynb
